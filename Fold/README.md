# Origami Fold Library

This library is an F# library designed for working with the origami [Fold Spec v1.1](https://github.com/edemaine/fold/blob/master/doc/spec.md) created by Eric Demaine.

The main functionality of this library is for (de)serialization into fold files. You can use this library directly to perform operations on the fold file format or you can use it to translate it into your internal data structure.
